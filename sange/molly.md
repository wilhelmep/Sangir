# Cockles and mussels *(Molly Malone)*

In Dublin’s fair city,  
where girls are so pretty,  
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone;  
as she wheel’d her wheel barrow,  
through streets broad and narrow,  
crying: “Cockles and mussels! alive, alive oh!  
Alive, alive oh! – Alive, alive oh!  
crying: “Cockles and mussels! alive, alive oh!”  

She was a fish monger,  
but sure ’twas no wonder  
for so were her father and mother before;  
and they each wheel’d their barrow  
through streets broad and narrow,  
crying …..

She died of a fever,  
and no one could save her,  
and that was the end of sweet Molly Malone;  
her ghost wheels her barrow  
through streets broad and narrow  
crying …..
